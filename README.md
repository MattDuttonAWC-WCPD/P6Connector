# P6Connector
This tool allows for remote connection to the WCPD P6 Instance via SOAP Web Services. App serves two functions.
1: Export timesheet information for the WCPD Missing Timesheet report.
2: Act as a lib for any other java projects wishing to access the P6 Web Services.

Note intention is to separate 1&2 into separate projects in future.

NB to run the above the following libs are required:
Oracle P6 developer tools
OpenCSV5 
Both sets of libs can be found within the reporting area of the WCPD Box share.
